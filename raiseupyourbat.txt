December

When the demon heart is crying
And the blood is gushing bright
Raise up your bat for the burning fight
When your hope is slowly dying
And your future's lost its rights
Raise up your bat and face the fright
Let's knock 'em dead into the night

Come follow me into the dark
With your heart as the ark
Which shall shine you the way
Because I'm with you in the dark
With your hеart as my mark
Which shall guide you the way, through the wavеs
Come follow me into the dark
With your heart as the ark
Which shall shine you the way
Because I'm with you in the dark
With your heart as my mark
Which shall guide you the way, through the waves

When the demon heart is crying
And the blood is gushing bright
Raise up your bat for the burning fight
When your hope is slowly dying
And your future's lost its rights
Raise up your bat and face the fright
Let's knock 'em dead into the night
