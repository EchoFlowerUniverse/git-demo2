December

When the demon heart is crying
And the blood is gushing bright
Raise up your bat for the burning fight
When your hope is slowly dying
And your future's lost its rights
Raise up your bat and face the fright
Let's knock 'em dead into the night

Come follow me into the dark
With your heart as the ark
Which shall shine you the way
Because I'm with you in the dark
With your hеart as my mark
Which shall guide you the way, through the wavеs
Come follow me into the dark
With your heart as the ark
Which shall shine you the way
Because I'm with you in the dark
With your heart as my mark
Which shall guide you the way, through the waves

When the demon heart is crying
And the blood is gushing bright
Raise up your bat for the burning fight
When your hope is slowly dying
And your future's lost its rights
Raise up your bat and face the fright
Let's knock 'em dead into the night


Ralsei

When the happy heart is smiling
And the Sun is shining bright
Raise up your hat for a funny sight
When your cat is slowly sighing
And its fur is looking white
Make sure to check your mat for mites
Let's get your friends and fly a kite

Come follow me into the dark
With your heart as the ark
Which shall shine you the way
Because I'm with you in the dark
With your hеart as my mark
Which shall guide you the way, through the wavеs
Come follow me into the dark
With your heart as the ark
Which shall shine you the way
Because I'm with you in the dark
With your heart as my mark
Which shall guide you the way, through the waves

When the sleepy duck is crying
And the mom is kiss goodnight
Raise up your bat for baseball delight
When your pancake's slowly frying
And your future's really bright
Bring extra smores to the campsite
I bet my friends still want a bite
